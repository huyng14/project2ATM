**Project create ATM simulation**

# Introduction

This project provides a technical approach for implementing ATM  application, using a number of different architectural diagrams to view different aspects of the system. It also presents the decisions that will govern how the application will be built from JAVA aspect

The [project-report.docx](https://github.com/huyng14/project2ATM/blob/master/doc/project-report.docx) documentâ€™s aim is to describe the architecture at high level, in which the system will be described as a set of functional layers, with technologies suggested for each layers.
